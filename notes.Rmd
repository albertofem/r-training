# Basic R types

- Numbers: logical (0/1) (booleans), integer, numeric, double
- String (type character)
- Dates

# Homogeneous structures

- Vector:

```{r}
a <- c(3,4,5)
a[2]
class(a)

# this a comment! 

seq(0, 100, 10)
rep("char", 3)

3*a

mixed_vector = c(1,2,"a") #Â coercion is converting to the more general
recursive_vector = c(c(1,2,3), "1", 2)
recursive_vector

mat <- matrix(c(a,a,a), ncol=3)
mat
```


## Heterogeneus structure

```{r}
mylist <- list(
    country = c("Portugal", "Spain", "Usa"),
    GDPGrowth = c(0.1,0.5,0.4)
)

mylist

names(mylist)
```
